In Java, it's not possible for a class to directly extend multiple classes (example with `class C extends A, B`). Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes. However, a class can implement multiple interfaces to achieve a form of multiple inheritance, but extending multiple classes directly is not allowed.

To simulate multiple inheritance for methods, you could use interfaces and implement those methods in the derived class. Here's an adjusted example:

```java
interface A {
    void myMethod();
}

interface B {
    void myMethod2();
}

class C implements A, B {
    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Good things sometimes become bad things with bad timings");
    }

    public void myMethod2() {
        // Method required by interface B
    }
}
```

In this example, the class `C` implements interfaces `A` and `B`, and it provides the required implementations for methods `myMethod()` and `myMethod2()`. This way, it achieves a form of multiple inheritance through interfaces.
