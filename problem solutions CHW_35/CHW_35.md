Recursion is an elegant programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. We will explore the mechanics of recursion, the importance of defining base cases to prevent infinite loops, and examples of how recursion can simplify complex problems.

## Functions in Java

With the advent of functional programming paradigms in Java, understanding functions is crucial. We'll discuss functional programming concepts, lambda expressions, higher-order functions, and how the Stream API enables function composition. Additionally, we'll explore built-in functional interfaces, which provide convenient tools for functional programming in Java.

## Conclusion

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of Java methods, recursion, and functions. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to write efficient and maintainable Java code, leverage the power of recursion for problem-solving, and embrace functional programming principles to enhance your software development skills.
